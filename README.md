# Software Verification, Validation and Testing Project 

Students on project: Burhan & Yaser 

The project we're doing here is about testing an online "shopify" store called: tsimplet.com. 

We will be testing the stores web page functionalities and components.

Few tests consist of: Closing the pop-up when opening home screen in order for testing to work better,
                      Passing Login data and making sure it passes through, 
                      and testing the "contact us" form and making sure it works.
